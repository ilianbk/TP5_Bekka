1. This code is about a "game" where a gilded si selling goods. The quality of the goods are constantly degrading through time.
Some specific goods increase their quality through time. The main purpose is to implement new features to allows the guilded to sell new items.

2. The goods are +5 Dexterity Vest/aged brie/sulfuras/Elixir of the Mongoose/Backstage passes/Conjured Mana Cake. They can be seen in the Program.cs file. 

3. When the day is over, Dexterity Vest and Elixir of the Mongoose will lose 1 point of quality. Sulfuras' quality won't change. Aged Brie and Backstage Passes
will actually increase their quality by 1. Conjured Mana Cake item is supposed to degrade in quality twice as fast as the others, but it's acutally not the case.

4. 

5. The quality of the good drop to 0 once the concert ticket goes over its expiration date

6. The name of class/variables make this code hard to read

7. Not really because I'm not an expert. Furthermore, despite the fact that the basic organisation of the solution is quite simple, we have no more information about what features
can optimize the solution. It's a bit vast.
